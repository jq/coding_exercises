Challenge: Fast power

Searching for a string in a large data store by simply comparing characters would take ages or a huge amount of computing power. We need a way to do it fast!

The first step to building a fast search algorithm is to encode the data in a format that makes search efficient.

A critical operation in the encoding process which weâ€™ll get familiar with a bit later is the exponentiation of integer numbers.

Given a list of pairs of integers (a,b)

Your task is to

    * write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) for each pair the result of (ab) modulo 4211 (one per line)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    * a
          o which is an array of integers giving the first element (a) of each pair
    * b
          o which is an array of integers giving the second element (b) of each pair

The ith pair is defined by a[i] and b[i].

Data constraints

    * the length of a, b arrays will not exceed 10000
    * elements of a, b arrays are integer numbers in the [0, 50000]

Efficiency constraints

    * your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less than 2 seconds
    * make sure you don't use any methods that do significant work for you (e.g. pow() in Python)

Example
Input   Output

a: 41619, 169, 29227, 13232
