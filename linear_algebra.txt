Coding the Matrix 

Python
Set comprehension  
S = {-4, 4, -3, 3, -2, 2}
{x for x in S if x >= 0 }

A X B - Cartesian product
Cardinality of Cartesian product = length of A X length of B 

{(x, y) : y = x^2}

Function - assigns a single output 
Domain  set of all input
Subdomain  set of all output
Image of q under function f(q) = r  where input actually maps to output
Image of cos(x) is {-1 <= x <= 1}
Range - some people use range for image and other as co-domain 

Identity function for any domain D 
    id : D -> D
Let
    f : A -> B and g : B -> C
    (g o f)  : A -> C
    g compose of f = g(f(x))

Associativity of function 
    h o (g o f) = (h o f) o f

Function inverse
  Function f and g are functional inverse and f o g and g o f are identity functions. A function that has an inverse is invertible.

  Invertible functions are one to one 

  Probability distribution function - sum to 1
    uniform distribution - (same probability to all outcomes)

Complex numbers 
    real + imaginary numbers 

Python  (uses j instad of i)
    3j
    x = 1 + 3j 
    (x-1) ** 2
    x.real x.imag 
    type(1+2j) 

addition is commutative: a + b = b + a 
multiplication distributes over addition: a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c
