right/left-hand-limit
    lim x->3+ f(x) = 2
    lim x->3- f(x) 3

If both limits are different then lim x->3 doesn't exist.


Continuous function 
    sqrt(2) =~ sqrt(1.99) =~ sqrt(2.01) 
    nearby input give newarby output
    f(x) = sqrt(x) is continuous at 2
    lim x-> f(x) = f(a), then f(x) is continuous at a 

Open interval (a, b)    between a, b
Closed interval [a, b]  -- inclusive
    lim x->a+ f(x) = f(a) 
    and
    lim x->b- f(x) = f(b)

Intermediate value theorem

Limit law of quotient (you can't use infinity)
    you calculate limit of numerator and denominator separately and then 
    divide those limits , e.g.
    lim x->infinity 2x/x+1 = 2x/x+1 . (1/x)/(1/x) = lim x->infinity 2 / (1 + 1/x)
    = 2 / 1 = 2

as infinity is not a number, you cannot use [0, infinity], you should use [0, infinity). You cannot use infinity - infinity, use limit 

potential and actual infinity 
lim x->inf (2x - x) = x(2-1) = x = infinity 

slope = height/width

Derivative 
    derivative of f at this point x:
        lim h->0    (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h
